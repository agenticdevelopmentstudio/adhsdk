The hook does one job, scroll-edge locking, and it touches only the DOM element it is given. `use-edge-lock.test.ts` covers mount, both resize directions, follow within the slack, leaving a reader put, the filtered-list regression, and both EL-1 and EL-2. It degrades gracefully when `ResizeObserver` is absent. It avoids re-wiring on every render and removes its listeners on unmount. State recovery is partial: element swaps reset cleanly, but a change to `edge` while the same element stays mounted leaves the scroll and resize handlers measuring from the old edge. That residual is described in `edge-change-while-mounted`.
