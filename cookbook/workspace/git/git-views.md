# Git Views

## Overview

The views of a git window: each one an AppKit view controller that reads one narrow data-source protocol of the [git repository model](cookbook:a2394ca0-3988-410b-9fc8-e0c9e253fc94) and reports what the user chose to a delegate, injected, so none of them knows its window or calls git. This recipe has one section per view. The **refs sidebar** (`GitRefsSidebarViewController`) lists, on the toolkit's [topic list](cookbook:ce223be3-818a-4310-b136-9e1e84e9af54), the working copy, the local branches, the remote branches grouped by remote, the tags, the stashes, the submodules and the linked worktrees, with ahead/behind badges on branches that track an upstream and the checked-out branch in bold.

## Behavioral Requirements

### Refs sidebar

- **sidebar-section-order**: The sidebar MUST list its sections in this order: `Workspace` (one row, `Working Copy`), `Branches` (local branches), one section per remote titled `Remotes · <remote>` (in the order each remote first appears in the refs), `Tags`, `Stashes`, `Submodules`, `Worktrees`. Rows keep the data source's order within a section.
- **sidebar-empty-sections-omitted**: A section with no rows MUST be left out, header included; `Workspace` always has its one row.
- **sidebar-row-titles**: A local branch or tag row MUST be titled with its name; a remote branch row with its name less the `<remote>/` prefix; a stash row with its message, or `stash@{N}` when the message is empty; a submodule row with its path; a worktree row with its directory's last path component. Bare worktrees MUST be left out.
- **sidebar-ahead-behind-badge**: A local branch row MUST carry a badge `↑n ↓m`, each half present only when its count is non-zero (`↑2 ↓1`, `↑2`, `↓1`), and no badge when both are zero. Other rows carry none.
- **sidebar-head-bold**: The checked-out branch's row MUST be emphasized (bold); no other row is.
- **sidebar-selection**: Selecting a row MUST call the delegate once: the working copy → `sidebarDidSelectWorkingCopy`; a branch, remote branch or tag → `didSelect ref`; a stash → `didSelectStash`; a submodule → `open directory` with the repository root joined with the submodule's path; a worktree → `open directory` with the worktree's directory. Clearing the selection calls nothing.
- **sidebar-reload**: `reload()` MUST rebuild every section from the data source's current values, keeping the selected row selected when its id is still present (by the topic list's restore-by-id) without calling the delegate, and dropping it otherwise.
- **sidebar-ui-thread**: The sidebar MUST be used on the UI thread.

## Appearance

### Refs sidebar

The topic list's appearance throughout. Icons (SF Symbols): working copy `square.and.pencil`, local branch `arrow.triangle.branch`, remote branch `network`, tag `tag`, stash `tray`, submodule `shippingbox`, worktree `folder`. The ahead/behind badge is the topic list's trailing badge; the checked-out branch uses its emphasized (bold) label.

## States

### Refs sidebar

- **Unborn repository**: only `Workspace` is listed (no refs yet), plus `Worktrees` when the data source lists one.
- **Selected row removed**: after a reload that no longer contains the selected row, nothing is selected.
- **Repository deleted**: the data source keeps its last values, so the sidebar keeps its last rows.

## Accessibility

### Refs sidebar

The sidebar's root view carries the identifier `git.sidebar`. Rows are the topic list's, so each row's label carries `topic-list.item.<slug of title>` and answers an accessibility press by selecting the row; a badge carries `topic-list.item.<slug>.badge`.

## Conformance Test Vectors

| ID | Requirements | Input | Expected |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|
| git-views-001 | sidebar-section-order, sidebar-row-titles | A fake source with branches `main` (head) and `dev`, remote branches `origin/main`, `upstream/main`, `origin/dev`, tag `v1`, a stash `WIP on main`, a stash with an empty message at index 1, submodule `lib/sub`, worktrees `/r` (main) and `/w/feature` | Sections `Workspace`, `Branches`, `Remotes · origin`, `Remotes · upstream`, `Tags`, `Stashes`, `Submodules`, `Worktrees`; rows `Working Copy`; `main`, `dev`; `main`, `dev`; `main`; `v1`; `WIP on main`, `stash@{1}`; `lib/sub`; `r`, `feature`. |
| git-views-002 | sidebar-ahead-behind-badge | Branches with (ahead, behind) (2, 1), (2, 0), (0, 3), (0, 0) | Badges `↑2 ↓1`, `↑2`, `↓3`, none. |
| git-views-003 | sidebar-head-bold | `main` is head, `dev` is not | `main` emphasized, `dev` not. |
| git-views-004 | sidebar-empty-sections-omitted | A source with one local branch and nothing else | Sections `Workspace`, `Branches` only. |
| git-views-005 | sidebar-selection | Select each row kind in turn | The delegate receives working copy; ref `refs/heads/main`; ref `refs/remotes/origin/main`; ref `refs/tags/v1`; the stash; directory `<root>/lib/sub`; directory `/w/feature`, once each. |
| git-views-006 | sidebar-reload | Source gains a branch `x`; `reload()` | `Branches` lists `x`; the delegate is not called. |

## Edge Cases

- **Null / empty input**: An unborn repository lists only the working copy (and its worktree).
- **Boundary values**: A branch with no upstream has ahead and behind 0 and so no badge.
- **Duplicate titles**: A local `main` and `origin/main` are both titled `main` in different sections; their row ids differ (the full ref name), so selection is unambiguous.
- **Awkward paths**: Submodule paths and worktree directories with spaces or unicode are shown as they are and joined to the root as path components, never as strings.
- **Concurrent access**: UI thread only.
- **Error states**: The sidebar shows whatever the data source last loaded; it has no error state of its own.
- **Offline / disconnected state**: Not applicable: no network.

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `source` | `GitRefsDataSource` | none | Where the sidebar reads refs, stashes, submodules, worktrees and the repository root. |
| `delegate` | `GitRefsSidebarDelegate?` | nil | Told what the user selected. |

## Deep Linking

Not applicable: the views define no URL scheme, route or navigation destination.

## Localization

Section titles (`Workspace`, `Branches`, `Remotes · <remote>`, `Tags`, `Stashes`, `Submodules`, `Worktrees`) and `Working Copy` are English literals today; ref names, messages and paths are shown verbatim.

## Accessibility Options

The topic list's fonts follow the theme; the emphasized row is bold text, not colour alone.

## Feature Flags

Not applicable: the views contain no feature-flag reference.

## Analytics

Not applicable: the views contain no analytics call.

## Privacy

The views show local repository data only and send nothing anywhere.

## Logging

Not applicable: the views log nothing; the model logs failed loads.

## Platform Notes

- **SwiftUI**: A `List` with `Section`s and `.badge(_:)` would serve; this toolkit's views are AppKit.
- **Compose**: A `LazyColumn` with sticky headers; the badge as trailing text.
- **React/Web**: A listbox with grouped options; the badge as a trailing span.
- **AppKit / UIKit**: AppKit: `@MainActor public final class GitRefsSidebarViewController: NSViewController` in `AgenticDeveloperHubSDKMacOS`, hosting a `TopicListViewController` as a child. UIKit: not applicable (no git on iOS).
- **WinUI 3**: A `ListView` with grouped items.

## Design Decisions

**Decision**: The sidebar hosts a topic list as a child rather than subclassing it.
**Rationale**: The sidebar's public surface is its data source, delegate and `reload()`; a subclass would also publish the list's own setters, letting a caller replace the sections behind the sidebar's back.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Remote branches are grouped as one flat section per remote (`Remotes · origin`) rather than nested under one `Remotes` header.
**Rationale**: The topic list is deliberately flat (no disclosure, no indentation); a section per remote groups them without a second list type.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The ahead/behind badge and the bold head row are topic-list features (`badge`, `isEmphasized`), not sidebar drawing.
**Rationale**: Built from the shared component upward: any sectioned sidebar can show a count or mark the current row, and the topic list keeps owning its cells.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The data source vends the repository root, so a submodule row can name its directory.
**Rationale**: `git submodule status` reports paths relative to the working tree; the model already knows its root.
**Approved**: pending

## Compliance

| Check | Status | Category |
|-------|--------|----------|
| [adc.check.best-practices.separation-of-concerns](cookbook:00bf1936-4bb6-4ba2-ba0a-6fc9a3697cd0/5ff14706-ab76-5c69-8a69-109919512b76) | passed | Best Practices |

`separation-of-concerns` passes because the views read data-source protocols and report to delegates; none calls git or knows its window. `unit-test-coverage` passes: `GitRefsSidebarViewControllerTests` covers section order and titles, badges, emphasis, omitted sections, selection of every row kind and reload, against a fake data source.
