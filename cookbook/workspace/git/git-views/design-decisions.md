**Decision**: The sidebar hosts a topic list as a child rather than subclassing it.
**Rationale**: The sidebar's public surface is its data source, delegate and `reload()`; a subclass would also publish the list's own setters, letting a caller replace the sections behind the sidebar's back.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Remote branches are grouped as one flat section per remote (`Remotes · origin`) rather than nested under one `Remotes` header.
**Rationale**: The topic list is deliberately flat (no disclosure, no indentation); a section per remote groups them without a second list type.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The ahead/behind badge and the bold head row are topic-list features (`badge`, `isEmphasized`), not sidebar drawing.
**Rationale**: Built from the shared component upward: any sectioned sidebar can show a count or mark the current row, and the topic list keeps owning its cells.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: The data source vends the repository root, so a submodule row can name its directory.
**Rationale**: `git submodule status` reports paths relative to the working tree; the model already knows its root.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: `GitHistorySearch` lives in `AgenticDeveloperHubSDKCore`, beside `GitLogQuery`, not with the view.
**Rationale**: It is pure Foundation; the lowest tier that can hold it is Core, where a CLI or another view can parse the same search text.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: `sha:` selects among loaded commits rather than filtering the log.
**Rationale**: The search is for finding a commit in context; filtering to one commit would hide the graph around it. A prefix not yet loaded selects nothing.
**Approved**: pending

**Decision**: Paging is asked for when the table requests a row near the end, and not again until the count or the query changes.
**Rationale**: The table only requests rows it is about to show, so the request is the visibility signal; the count guard keeps a finished history from reloading in a loop.
**Approved**: pending
