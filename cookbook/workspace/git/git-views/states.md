### Refs sidebar

- **Unborn repository**: only `Workspace` is listed (no refs yet), plus `Worktrees` when the data source lists one.
- **Selected row removed**: after a reload that no longer contains the selected ref or stash, `Working Copy` is selected and the delegate is told.
- **Repository deleted**: the data source keeps its last values, so the sidebar keeps its last rows.

### History list

- **Unborn repository / empty history**: no rows; nothing throws, and no text stands in for the rows.
- **Paging**: further rows appear as the data source loads them; the selection is kept.
- **Selected commit removed**: after a reload that no longer contains the selected commit, nothing is selected and the delegate is told nil.
- **Repository deleted**: the data source keeps its last values, so the list keeps its last rows.
