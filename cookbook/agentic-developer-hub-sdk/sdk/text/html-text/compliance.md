`HTMLText` is one pure type with two entry points and private helpers per stage (tags, writer, breaks, entities, whitespace), no I/O and no state, which is separation of concerns. `HTMLTextTests` covers entity decoding, control and invisible characters, every tag family, `pre`, unterminated constructs and hostile-input timing; a few behaviors (declarations, bogus close tags, unbalanced `pre`, private-use input) have no test, so coverage is strong but not complete. The input is sanitized for terminal use by dropping control characters and for resource use by the single pass. The result is partial for explicit error handling because the functions have no error channel: malformed markup is silently truncated or left as written, by the contract's own wording, and the caller cannot tell it happened.
